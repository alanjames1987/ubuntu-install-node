Ubuntu Install Node

This is a bash script I use to install my Node.JS servers.

It installs Node v0.10.21 using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Run install-nosu.sh with as a normal user.
Run install-su.sh as a su. You MUST sudo su before running it or the install will fail.

Other software installed
